# Airline Traffic Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI.)
## Project objective:
To analyze airline traffic by tracking the number of departures, arrivals, and takeoffs across various days, months, and airports to identify traffic patterns and optimize scheduling using interactive dashboards.
## Data set used
-<a href="https://github.com/nimmagantiharini/Data--Analysis--Dashboard---Power-BI/blob/main/Airline%20Excel.xlsx" > Airlines Traffic data </a>

## Questions(KPI):
1.What is the total sum of average flight delays in minutes across all flights?
2.count of number of flights.
3.What is the total number of cancelled, delayed, and on-time flights for each day of the week?
4.create the airline names.
5.What is the total number of cancelled, delayed, and on-time flights for each day of the week?
6.What is the sum of average delays by airline name and year?
7.How many flights departed each hour, segmented by airline, origin airport, day of the week, and month?

##Process
- verify data of any missing values and anomalies, sort out the same.
- Made Airline traffic data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format ad values used.
- Upload the data in Power BI desktop and transform the data, ready to use.

## project insight

-Analyzed flight data to identify trends in departures, arrivals, delays, and cancellations by airline, day of the week, month, and origin airport.
-Dashboard 1 highlights total flight volume, average delays, and performance comparison across airlines, along with time-based trends.
-Dashboard 2 focuses on hourly departure patterns based on airline, origin airport, weekday, and monthly distributions.
-Insights reveal peak delay periods, busiest flight hours, and which airlines maintain better on-time performance.
-These findings support operational decisions in resource allocation, schedule planning, and service quality improvements.

## Final conclusion

The airline traffic dashboards provide a comprehensive view of flight operations by analyzing key metrics such as delays, cancellations, and on-time performance. By breaking down data by airline, day of the week, month, origin airport, and departure hour, the analysis reveals critical patterns and operational bottlenecks. Airlines with consistent delays and peak congestion hours can be clearly identified, enabling strategic improvements. The dashboards support data-driven decision-making for optimizing flight schedules, enhancing punctuality, and improving overall service efficiency.
